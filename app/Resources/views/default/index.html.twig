    <h2>Shrimp & black bean quesadillas</h2>
    <p>
        200 g large raw prawns , from sustainable sources<br>
        1 tablespoon smoked paprika<br>
        1 tablespoon vegetable oil<br>
        250 g mature cheddar cheese<br>
        4 large flour tortillas<br>
        400 g black beans<br>
        4 tablespoons pickled jalapeños , plus extra to serve<br>
        2 tablespoons coriander , plus extra to serve<br>
        sour cream and salsa , to serve<br>
    </p>
    <p> In a small bowl, toss the prawns with the smoked paprika and some salt and pepper. Heat a small frying pan
        with 1 teaspoon of the oil. Sear the prawns for 1 minute each side. Remove, let cool and halve lengthways.
        Set aside.

        Spread half of the cheese over two tortillas. Drain the beans and roughly chop the jalapeños, then sprinkle
        over, along with the prawns. Finely chop the coriander, then divide between the tortillas, cover with the
        remaining cheese and top with the other tortillas.

        Divide the rest of the oil between two frying pans and place them over a low–medium heat. Brown the
        tortillas on one side for 3 to 4 minutes, until the cheese is melted and golden, taking care not to let them
        burn. Turn them over and cook for 3 minutes. If the pan is looking a little dry, add another tiny drizzle of
        vegetable oil.

        Once the cheese has melted, remove the quesadillas from the pan and cut each one into six triangles. Serve
        straight away, topped with a dollop of sour cream and salsa, the pickled jalapeños and coriander leaves
